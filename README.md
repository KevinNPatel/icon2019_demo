# Time Series Forecasting
## Demo at ICON 2019

The goal of these demos was to show that the length 12 (which was discovered using statistical methods) helped the deep learning models perform better

The three folders correspond to the three demos presented at the tutorial:
1. Study of the effect of length of previous timestamp data on the performance of LSTM networks
2. Study of the effect of length of previous timestamp data on the performance of Enc-Dec with Attention networks

Each notebook filename is suffixed by the length of data considered in that particular notebook.

One can clearly observe that the models trained with 12 length clearly outperform others, thereby supporting our hypothesis.
